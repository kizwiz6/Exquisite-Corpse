Extend the BuildACreature() method so that all of its parameters are optional. It should assign a random body part if a parameter is not specified.

Recreate this program so that rather than outputting a creature immediately, it prompts a user to select which parts of each creature to use to build a new creature.

Add a starting mode, so a user can select whether to randomly generate a creature or create one manually.

Use this ASCII art archive to add other body parts to the program.
