# Exquisite Corpse
### This is a Codecademy project.

In the game Exquisite Corpse, participants draw either a head, body, or feet of a creature. The players don’t know how their part of the body connects to the other two, until the drawing is finished and revealed.

For this project, you’ll write a program that mimics the Exquisite Corpse game. Using methods, you’ll be able to randomly combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature.

To complete this project, you will need to be familiar with:
- How to automate the process of calling functions.
- How to define a method's return type in its method signature.
- How to refactor your code to make it more DRY.
